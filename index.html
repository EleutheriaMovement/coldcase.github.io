INTRO

"Look here I will not bit about the bush, I may not be as bad as that clown Fikile, but it is clear that am no longer as effective as before, I cannot function freely because of the corrupted government. I look like an idiot in a police uniform, look now am supposed to solve this Xhenophobia saga which they created to shift focus from the Watson case. That is why I am appointing you to head this case, Do you accept this challenge?"

"You need to find out what happened, was it a foul play, just an accident or his death was faked. Your first lead is to target the two eye witnesses, who claim to have seen this. however you have a very limited time to crack the case, do not attract negative publicity, and stay alive.."

- Go to the witness [WITNESS]

WITNESS

"Tell me what you saw on that day?" [guy.png] 

"I saw mr Watson speeding a white Toyota towards the arrival area as the road curved he did not slow down and hit the concrete pillar" [gal.png]

- Move to the next witness [WITNESS2]
- Continue interview[THE FIGHT]

- Restart [INTRO]
THE FIGHT
"How did you know that it was Mr Watson?" [guy.png]

"I assume it was him, since they found his body there" [gal.png]

"So you saw the body?" [guy.png]

"No Officer I only saw the car"

- Move to the next witness. [WITNESS2]
- Continue interview. [CONTINUATION]
- Take the witness into custody.[PUBLICITY]

CONTINUATION
Time running out...the witness is starting to loose patience with you!
"It seems like you are unsure of your stories, am beginning to doubt your testimony" [guy.png]

"Am I your suspect Officer, cause if that is the case I would need my lawyer?" [gal.png]

- Allow the witness to call their lawyer. [THE LAWYER]
- Move to the next witness[WITNESS2]

THE LAWYER
Unfortunately you have run out of time and the lawyer has discredited the methods you used on his client, you have reached a dead End!!!
													Game Over!
WITNESS2
Detective your second witness gave almost the same statement except that he claims he went to the scene after the accident...

- Interview the second witness[WITNESS2TEST]
- Go to the scene[PHONECALL]

WITNESS2TEST

"Tell me about what you saw at the scene, what did you see there?" [guy.png]

"I saw the Toyota crashed beyond recognition on the front"

"Did you see the body?"

"No I did not, as we were blocked from the scene"

"Is there anything atleast what you noticed, anything?"

"Well it was strange that the officers who were attending to this, were not wearing gloves and there was no red tape"

Clearly something is fishy about this case, nobody saw Mr Watson driving the car or his body after the accident,
and what this witness has just said gives you a reason to dig deeper...How about you go to the scene, who knows you might find something.

-Go to the scene[PHONECALL]
